  and each additional page has further information on streaming services and my own personal shows to watch. Most of the code is using JavaScript and the TV Maze API to gather information.</p>

  <h3>Define A Place - Bryant Park</h3>
    <p id="videotext">Defining a place based on its structure and what it holds not focusing so much in the people, but the place itself. I contrasted my video from day to night to show
    the difference in ambiance of the park.</p>

    <p id="videotext">This project was part of my Documentary Film class where we filmed a community based project concerning different

  <h3>Single Shot Video - An Afternoon Snack</h3>
    <p id="videotext">Sometimes expectations are not what reality gives you. In this single-shot video I wanted it to represent exactly how one would feel when they’re wanting (or in this case craving) something,
      and it turns out not how one would expect it. While my approach may seem simplistic as opposed to realistic unachievable expectations, I still believe it links the need to get something that you think is there but not. </p>

    <h3>Found Footage - Being A Woman</h3>
      <p id="videotext">When I think about presenting found footage that will somehow be meaningful to me, I wanted to showcase what the reality of being a woman is. While there’s a lot of women empowerment in today’s media, the reality is that a lot of women are still suffering around the world with failed humanitarian involvements. The media is quick to want to show that women have begun to fight back and get more rights, which is true somewhat but the dark contrast of that is that women still have little to no voice on many countries around the world. </p>

      <h3>Final - Love of Bread</h3>
        <p id="videotext">As this is my last personal film project, I thought a lot of what I wanted to do, and with this experimental video I wanted to choose a topic that I would be able to have fun with. I chose to express the joy of eating bread and to simply have found footage of any commercialized bread video and people showcasing different breads all over the world. </p>
